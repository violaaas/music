# How to Generate a Click Track

A [click track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_track) is an audio track that contains
metronomic beats that correspond to a piece of music. It helps ensure that you can
synchronize the performances when combining them into the final collaborative virtual video.

This guide shows you how to create basic click tracks with no tempo changes as well
as more advanced click tracks that contain tempo changes.


## Basic Click Track

While several software applications feature click track generation, this
guide explains how to create one with a free, open source audio editor called [Audacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audacity_(audio_editor)).


### Step 1 - Install and Open Audacity

If you do not already have it installed, [download](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) it for the operating system
that you use and install it.

After you open Audacity, a new audio track editor window that contains menu options at the top should appear. From the
menu, select the **Generate** menu item and then the **Rhythm Track** sub-menu item as shown below.

## Step 2 - Configure the Click Track

From your menu selection in the previous step, a new dialog window should appear which contains the parameters of your
click track which should resemble the following:

Update the "Tempo (bpm) and "Beats per bar" settings to match the piece of music being performed.
For example, if your meter is 3/4 and metronome marking is 72, you'll want to set the "Tempo (bpm)" setting to 72 and the
"Beats per bar" to 3.

Update the "Number of bars" setting to the number of bars in the piece of music being performed, and add two extra
bars to give your performance the chance to prepare.  Make sure to communicate the preparation measures to the performers,
either in your Recording Plan, or directly.

If you want the click track to provide a different pitch for downbeats, update the "MIDI pitch of strong beat" setting
to a number different than the "MIDI pitch of weak beat". Each number corresponds to a specific half step in a chromatic scale
in increasing order: the higher the number, the higher the pitch.

You can click the "Preview" button to listen to a short sample of the current settings before you generate the full
click track. Click the "OK" button to generate the full click track.

## Step 3 - Review the Click Track

After clicking the "OK" button, the dialog box should close and you should show a graphic representation of the audio
within an "Audio Track" as follows. You can click the play button at the top to listen to the current click track.

If you discover you made a mistake in the settings you chose, you can close the click track audio file by opening the "File" menu 
and selecting the "Close" item. When prompted as to whether you want to save changes to the project, click "No". Otherwise, 
if you're ready to save the click track, proceed

## Step 4 - Save the Click Track

Select the File menu and Export menu choice. From there, select "Export as WAV" as shown below. Choose a filename and
directory to save it to.

## Step 5 - Share the Click Track

To share the click track, you need to make it available online. If you are not certain what service to use or how to
upload files from your computer to a sharing service, read one of the following tutorials:
