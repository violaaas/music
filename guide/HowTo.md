Overview
--------

This guide provides an opinionated way to produce a video of a *collaborative virtual performance*.

A collaborative virtual performance is a collage presentation of two or more videos in which
each performer (or group of performers) records an individual video of their performance part.
These videos are synchronized and combined in a single video to form a virtual group performance which can be shared online.

See these [examples of collaborative virtual performances](PerformanceList).


What You Need
-------------

**People**

- __Performers__ - includes musicians, conductors, and anyone else on-screen
- __Audio/Video Engineer__ - someone familiar with or can learn how to use audio and video editors
- __Project Organizer__ - this person communicates with all the musicians, sets deadlines and reminds people about them, and has access all the informational material.

**Music**

- __Parts__ for the piece you want to perform that you can distribute online

**Equipment**

- Each performer needs a device that can record audio and video, a separate device to play back the click track, and headphones/earphones to listen to the click track.
They also need an internet connection and a place to upload their recorded videos unless the Project Organizer can provide it.
- The Audio/Video Engineer needs a reasonably fast computer, lots of free disk space to install necessary applications and to master the video/audio, and a decent internet connection.


Process
-------

## Phase I - Planning and Recording

**[Project Organizer]**
- Identify the piece (should be appropriate for the group of musicians you expect to participate)
- Procure the music parts and if they are not already in a format that the performers can easily print or read from a screen such as PDF.
- Set deadlines based on communications with everyone involved.
- Contact the musicians to communicate deadlines and get their consent to participate. If any of the musicians are children, you may need to provide an official consent form for a parent/guardian to sign.
- Ensure there are enough participants to cover all the essential parts and otherwise find additional participants and communicate the aforementioned with them.
- Create a recording plan with the Audio/Video Engineer. Communicate this to all the musicians. Placeholder: See what is an ideal recording plan

**[Audio/Video Engineer]**
- Work with a conductor or party responsible for setting the tempo/interpretation.
- Create a click track represents the tempo/interpretation discussed. Placeholder: See what is a click track and how to create it.
- Check in with conductor/musician to ensure the click track is correct.
- Make the click track available for download by everyone in the project (musicians, audio/video engineer, and project manager).

**[Performers]**
- Review the Recording Plan. Clarify any questions you might have with the Project Organizer.
- The Recording Plan should include details for all the following steps.
- Practice with the click track.
- Prepare your performance space and equipment and do a test run or two. Check your recording to ensure everything looks and sounds good. Check your recording for clipping or other background noise.
- Film your performance with the click track until you think you've gotten your take.
- Check your final take(s). TODO: How to check your recording
- Upload your audio/video to a file hosting site and notify the Project Organizer.

## Phase II - Producing and Releasing

**[Project Organizer]**
- Once all the recordings have come in, notify the Audio/Video Engineer.

**[Audio/Video Engineer]**
- Download and assemble the videos. TODO: Guide on how to with different software
- Render the final video and upload it to a video hosting site. Notify the Project Organizer.
- Follow any additional steps such as tagging and making it available on social media or other video hosting site. Notify the Project Organizer once completed.
