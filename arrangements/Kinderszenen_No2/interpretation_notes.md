# Interpretation Notes

So, normally, you would be able to play this together before performing to make decisions and adjustments on how you'd like it to sound, but since that's difficult to accomplish remotely, I just wanted to give you some hints as to how you might proceed with the interpretation and phrasing.

A couple quick notes to get out of the way:
* I added a bar and two beats of rest so that you would have time to get your instrument ready after pressing play on the click track. I probably should've added a couple more bars, so maybe I'll go back and do that.
* You'll see some numbers such as 108, 94, or 80 above certain measures. These are tempo changes that I needed to insert to control the ritards in the playback. You can also use them as hints for anticipating the changes in tempo in the click track.

The piece is a little repetitive (ABABA), but it's short so I think it sounds fine without creating too much variation between them. Each A section is about 8 bars long and B sections are about 4 bars long. You'll want to treat each as a single phrase.

The A section is alternating I, V, and V7 chords with some secondary dominants to modulate to an adjacent key. The marking here should probably be con spirito. I personally pictured the type of excitement that a child gets when you show them a new book with colorful illustrations. Make sure the grace notes are clearly articulated and come before the beat. If necessary, you can play them as sixteenths.

One interesting feature is that there's a slight variation in which a leading chord happens at the beginning such as the pickup to 24 (note the b sharps). I think this is an anticipation of the A9 chord (dominant chord in E). This anticipation can be brought out a little bit although it's not marked.

The B section (the first of which starts at the pickup before measure 20) is a little more interesting with the addition of iv and vi chords, with modulations into G major (which is what key the prior piece in this series is in) and E minor. For this section, I pictured the child reading the story asking a question whether to themself or whoever is reading it. Even though it's marked piano, I might go back and mark it calore (warm) or con amore (with tenderness).
