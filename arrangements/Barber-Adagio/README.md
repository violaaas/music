# Barber Adagio (for 4 violas) Files

This directory contains the score, extracted parts, and audio click track for the piece.

While I would recommend the audio-only click track, you can download the [full score clicktrack](https://angry-bee.com/music/BarberAdagio/Barber_Adagio-score-clicktrack.mp4).

Let me know if you find any issues with the parts so that I can correct them. I made some quick corrections, but the "extract parts" feature in Finale (music notation editor) is not perfect.
