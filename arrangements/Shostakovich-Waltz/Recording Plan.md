## How to Use the Click Track

- Download the version of the click track file you want to use onto your playback device to which you can connect headphones. Familiarize yourself with the click track; each starts with exactly two measures of clicks for each beat to allow you to prepare to play.

- Connect your headphones (wireless/bluetooth reduces the chance of getting tangled) to your playback device and try to adjust it such that you can hear both the click track as well as yourself playing simultaneously. If your headphones are wired, make sure that they do not obstruct your normal motion while performing. Also make sure that the sound coming through your headphones are not audible in the recording.

### Video Recommendations

- Orientation of the camera
  - For spoken messages, use a horizontal/landscape orientation
  
  - For instrumental/vocal performances, choose an orientation that best frames you and your instrument.

  - Try to get your face and at least half of your instrument in the frame if possible.

- Lighting
  - The best quality light source is natural light because it's bright and full spectrum which helps render colors better. It also allows your camera's sensor lower its sensitivity to light which usually means less noise in the video you are capturing. Since natural light might not always be available, use as bright a light you feel comfortable with and place it behind the camera facing you. Avoid shadows cast on you and your instrument, and different colored light sources as they can produce unflattering results.
  
- Backdrop
  - Try to find a background that is stationary, relatively organized, and isn't directing light towards the camera.

- Video padding
   - Start recording at least five seconds before you start playing and leave at least five seconds at the end. Smile!

### Sound Recommendations

- Sound Recording
  - Tuning **TBD** by the group

  - To prevent sound distortion, make sure to test your recording device to ensure that your loudest notes are not clipping (too loud for the mic to register which causes distortion and crackles). If the sound is clipping, move the device further away from your instrument when recording. For more information on clipping, listen to [this example of clipping](https://youtu.be/9uEtworGLrU?t=124).

  - If you have a separate microphone, it's usually more open sounding if positioned at a height just above your instrument and 6 more more feet away.

  - Your recording device may adjust its sensitivity automatically (increased sensitivity when it gets quiet and decreased sensitivity when it gets loud), so you may need to put extra effort into producing a piano or softer dynamic.
  
  - Make sure the room is quiet.
    - Close windows (and doors)

    - Turn off fans/humidifiers/heaters/air purifiers when possible

    - Silence cellphone, computer speakers, tablets, TVs, etc.

    - Ask your cohabitators to be quiet while you record

## How to Submit your Recording

Upload it to Dropbox, Google Drive, or other file sharing service from which you can share a download link without specific credentials. 
If possible, name your file using the following format to make it easier for me to organize:

```
Shostakovich-Waltz-<part>.<format>
```

Example:

```
Shostakovich-Waltz-Viola-IV.mp4
```

Your recording device might re-compress the video when attempting to upload it or send it. For best results, use Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, iCloud, or Dropbox.

Once uploaded, send me the link. If you attempt to attach the file to the email, it may silently fail because of the size of the file. This means that I will never even know that you tried to send it.
