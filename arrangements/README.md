# What's in Here

These directories contain music notation and video files for performers to use
to create a virtual collaborative video (not certain whether there's a canonical term for this yet)
in which each performer records video and audio of themselves playing an individual part.
Once complete, the videos and audio are combined and postprocessed.

Here are a few examples of this type of video, produced by other groups:

* [Mozart Marriage of Figaro](https://youtu.be/9Bacj8z6SRU)
* [Toronoto Symphony](https://youtu.be/5rzZ2F18MwI)
* [Calgary Philharmonic](https://youtu.be/ZXeA2--_4eE)
* [Cello Octet](https://youtu.be/ZzLkiF-OQ-4)

# Tips on Creating a Quality Recording:

### Lighting:

The best quality light source is natural light because it's bright and full spectrum which helps render colors better. It also allows your camera's sensor to use
a lower sensitivity which usually means less visual in the video you are capturing. Since natural light might not always be available, use as bright a light you feel comfortable with and place it behind the camera facing you. Try to avoid multiple colors from your light sources as it can produce unflattering color casts.

### Framing: 

Check your framing to make sure that you're including at least your face and viola are within the bounds of the video frame most of the time.
Do a couple test runs to determine whether it's the angle you want. Other tips in this [NYTimes article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/realestate/coronavirus-webcam-appearance.html).
For backgrounds, unchanging, plan backgrounds are a safe bet.

### What to Wear:

Coordinate with your group on what works best.

### Sound Recording:

Recording in a quiet room (if possible in your environment) with fewer echos is preferred, but not an anechoic chamber.
Make sure to test out your recording device to make sure that your loudest notes are not clipping (too loud for the mic to register which causes distortion and crackles). If the sound is clipping, move the device further away from your instrument when recording. For more information on clipping, listen to 
[this example of clipping](https://youtu.be/9uEtworGLrU?t=124).

If you have a separate microphone, it's usually more open sounding if positioned at a height above your instrument and 6 more more feet away.

Your recording device may adjust its sensitivity automatically (increased sensitivity when it gets quiet and decreased sensitivity when it gets loud), so you may need to put extra effort into producing a piano or softer dynamic.

### Following the Click Track

This is perhaps the most difficult part to execute. There are a few approaches that other collaborative video creators have successfully used. See the
[video on the Elgar Nimrod Variations project](https://youtu.be/URZ8cWAspAw) for a video of a few suggested approaches. A few tips:

* Make sure you and your group are clear on all the tempo decisions
* Practice (first without doing any recording), practice, practice
* Make sure you can simultaneously read the music, listen to the click track, and record a video. You may need multiple electronic devices to accomplish this.

### Tuning:

Since you cannot hear your collaborators as you perform, it is helpful to tune to the same A. You can find audio files to help you tune in the [Tuning directory](https://github.com/violaaas/music/tree/master/arrangements/Tuning)


# Sharing Your Individual Videos

Once you've created your video, upload it to Dropbox, Google Drive, or other sharing site and email a link to the person putting together the video. The video files can be large in size (depending on the resolution and amount of time recorded) and won't fit in an email or on GitHub. For the best quality, download the file from your device. Some methods of transfer reduce the quality of the video by compressing the data in a way that you lose detail in the audio or video. Upload your video file to a file sharing service rather than a video sharing one. Video sharing sites often re-compress your video which may reduce the quality.
