# Kinderszenen No. 7 Files

This directory contains the score, extracted parts, and audio click track for the piece.

The full score clicktrack (video playback on the full score with clicks) was too large to upload to this site, so it is hosted on my personal site here:
[Full score clicktrack](https://angry-bee.com/music/Kinderszenen_No7/Kinderszenen_No7_score_clicktrack.mp4)

For recording, I would recommend using the full score clicktrack, linked above. If the notes in that video are too small to read on your display, use the audio click track. Unfortunately, I was not able to get the individual part playback to synchronize with the score clicktrack.

Let me know if you find any issues with the parts so that I can correct them. I made some quick corrections, but the "extract parts" feature in Finale (music notation editor) is not perfect.
